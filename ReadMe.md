# LearningPytorch
By Yan Wang 4/27/2018
Some simple demos for learning pytorch
I use these demos to be familiar with the pytorch and to learn the the influence of different parameters on the model.I modify these codes to analytical different models better.

## testMNIST
Reference: [pytorch/examples](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/master/mnist/)
For MNIST, I get a basic model from the link,and try different parameters to observe the changes of the model,finally finish the visualization of the result.
for more detail,you can see [My Blog](https://superyanyann.github.io/2018/04/20/DLinCV-MNIST-Part1/#more)

## textClassfication
Reference: [ne7ermore](https://github.com/ne7ermore/torch_light/tree/master/lstm-text-classfication)
I modify the main.py and the model.py to analytical the model
The project is in progress
